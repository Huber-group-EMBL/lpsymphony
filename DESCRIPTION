Package: lpsymphony
Title: Symphony integer linear programming solver in R
Version: 0.99.2
Description: The package derives from Rsymphony, R interface to
    SYMPHONY on CRAN, open-source linear programming solver written in
    C++. Unlike Rsymphony, the package includes the solver source code
    directly. The configure script makes the installation process easier
    on Mac OS and Linux. Windows DLLs make it possible to install the
    package with Rtools.
